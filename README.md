### TaskManagerApp 📝

TaskManagerApp is a Python-based task management application that provides multiple interfaces to manage daily tasks:

1. CLI (Command Line Interface) version

2. Desktop GUI application version

3. Web application version

The goal of this project is to explore different ways of building the same core functionality using different interfaces, all within a single codebase.

⚠️ This project is currently Work In Progress (WIP).
